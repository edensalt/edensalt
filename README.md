## My backstory

📈 Before my pivot into programming, I worked for early-stage health-tech start-ups, focusing on marketplace operations and account management. I'm naturally drawn to the energy of start-up environments and the mission of healthcare companies.

🌊 I am a graduate of Tulane University (roll wave!) My degree in public health drives my passion for helping patients in my work, and one of my core values is supporting others in achieving good health.

## Fun facts

📖 I am an avid reader and especially drawn to sci-fi.

🧗‍♀️ I'm a rock climber and enjoy spending my weekends out at the crag.

☕️ Like most programmers, I have a coffee addiction. My mornings always start with a pour-over.
