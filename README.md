### Welcome! Thanks for stopping by 👋

Below, you'll find a bit of info about me. Feel free to scroll further and check out my public repos, most of which are demonstrations of the skills I've built through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">the Odin Project</a>.

## About me

👩‍💻 I'm Eden, software engineer in progress. I began my programming journey in February 2023, pivoting my career in order to build beautiful, intuitive products for people to use to make their lives a little easier!

## My stack

📚 I am proficient in HTML, CSS and basic Javascript. I'm also familiar with Tailwind, React and Vite. I'm looking forward to growing this list as I continue my learning!

## How I'm learning

📓 I'm currently completing The Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript">Full Stack Javascript course</a>. I've already completed their <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Foundations course</a>.

## My backstory

📈 Before I started programming, I worked for early-stage health-tech start-ups, focusing on marketplace operations and account management. I'm naturally drawn to the energy of start-up environments, and my work always focused on optimization, building my skillset of process improvement and project management.

🌊 I am a graduate of Tulane University (roll wave!) My degree in public health drives my passion for helping patients in my work, and one of my core values is supporting others in achieving good health.

## Fun facts

📖 I am an avid reader, and GoodReads is my favorite social media platform!

♟️ I've recently gotten into chess (I hear this is a thing programmers do), and I enjoy taking coding breaks on chess.com.

🎸 I play guitar and am currently learning the bass, which isn't too challening, as it's essentially 2/3 of the instrument I already know!
